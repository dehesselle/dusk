# Dusk - switch screen(s) to black
Dusk is a little tool that can dim individual screens in your multi-monitor setup by overlaying them with translucent black borderless windows. Its purpose is that you don't have to turn your other monitors off if you quickly want to get rid of any distractions (e.g. when watching a movie).

- Press `<Shift>` to easily identify which display corresponds to what number.
- Use the scroll wheel to adjust the opacity of the overlay.
