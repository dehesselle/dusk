# Dusk - switch screen(s) to black
Dusk is a little tool that can quickly switch individual screens in your multi-monitor setup to black by overlaying them with black borderless windows. Its purpose is that you don't have to turn your other monitors off if you want to watch a movie on your main screen without distractions.
