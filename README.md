# Dusk - switch screen(s) to black
Dusk is a little tool that can switch individual screens in your multi-monitor setup to black by overlaying them with translucent black borderless windows. Its purpose is that you don't have to turn your other monitors off if you quickly want to get rid of any distractions (e.g. when watching a movie).
